- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, My name is Steve Robertson. My GitHub username is @IosStever
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming. I have over 13 years of on-the-job experience with PL/SQL (Oracle). I enjoy the challenge of creating queries and reports that streamline daily processes, help with troubleshooting or track performance to goals. But I also like creating apps with all the endless possibilities to help people that they present. To that end, I spent four years studying and developing iOS apps (Mostly in Swift but some in SwiftUI). In the last couple of years, my focus has turned to Web Development, and more recently to Python.
- ðŸ“« I spend most of my free time studying but I can be reached on Twitter at @SteveRiosApps

Have a great day!
